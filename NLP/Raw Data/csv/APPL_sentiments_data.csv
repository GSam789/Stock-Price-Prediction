Wall Street is on track to end 2023 on a solid note.

Growing optimism that Fed interest rates and U.S. inflation have peaked, combined with hopes for a soft-landing will continue to impact sentiment in 2024.

As such, investors should consider buying Charles Schwab, PayPal, and Dollar General as the trio of beaten-down stocks are poised to rebound.

Stocks on Wall Street are on track to close out 2023 on a solid note with investors growing increasingly optimistic that that the Federal Reserve may be done raising rates amid cooling inflation and as the economy holds up better than expected.

The tech-heavy has led the year-to-date charge higher, rising 36.4%, while the benchmark and the blue-chip are up 18.6% and 6.8% respectively for the year.

With Fed policy, , and soft-landing prospects likely to remain front and center for investors in 2024, I recommend buying shares of these three beaten-down companies thanks to their improving fundamentals and reasonable valuations.

1. Charles Schwab

Year-To-Date Performance: -33%

Market Cap: $101.7 Billion

As one of the nation’s most interest-rate-sensitive financial institutions, Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) found itself caught up in concerns over the health of its balance sheet and the specter of rising interest rates. Shares of the online stock brokerage - which are hovering near their lowest level since November 2020 - have lost 33% year-to-date due to worries about the strength of the banking sector.

Charles Schwab Daily Chart

However, a closer examination suggests these fears might be exaggerated. Schwab's proactive measures to navigate through higher interest rates to maximize profitability, coupled with its impressive track record of customer acquisition, paint a promising picture for a potential rebound in 2024.

Although the financial services company faces headwinds due to the challenging operating environment, its successful integration of the TD Ameritrade merger significantly expanded its customer base. The Westlake, Texas-based discount broker had 34.6 million active brokerage accounts as of the end of October, 5.2 million corporate retirement plan participants, 1.8 million banking accounts, and $7.65 trillion in total client assets.

While missteps with low-interest-rate loans and the negative impact from higher borrowing costs have cast shadows, Schwab stock's current valuation seems disconnected from its intrinsic strength. For investors willing to wager on the eventual subsiding of these headwinds, Schwab's undervalued status becomes an enticing option.

As InvestingPro points out, SCHW stock is currently trading at a bargain valuation. Shares could see an increase of 33.5% from last night’s closing price of $55.82, which would bring them closer to their ‘Fair Value’ of $74.53.

At its current valuation, Charles Schwab - which stands about 42% below its all-time peak of $96.24 reached in February 2022 - has a market cap of $101.7 billion, making it the sixth largest U.S. banking institution.

2. PayPal

Year-To-Date Performance: -17.9%

Market Cap: $63 Billion

PayPal (NASDAQ: ) has faced significant headwinds this year amid increased competition in the digital payments industry from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Block. Shares of the San Jose, California-based fintech leader, which are languishing near their lowest level since mid-2017, have considerably underperformed the broader market in 2023, losing almost 18% year-to-date.

PayPal Daily Chart

Yet, beneath the surface, PayPal exhibits resilient strengths and characteristics. The mobile payments processing company's revenues, profits, and total payment volume have all continued to grow despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment. In addition, the company's shift toward embracing newer revenue streams, including the surge in buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) options, offers a major diversification advantage.

Despite recent turmoil, PayPal shares are poised to recover under the leadership of new CEO Alex Chriss, who came over from Intuit (NASDAQ: ), as the digital payments giant steers towards an era of operational efficiency and streamlined growth.

Indeed, PayPal's recently third-quarter financial update was well received by Wall Street. Adjusted earnings per share increased 20% year-over-year to $1.30, while sales rose 8% annually to $7.41 billion. In an encouraging sign, total payment volume, a key performance indicator for the business, jumped 15% to $387.7 billion.

It should be noted that PYPL stock is extremely cheap at the moment according to InvestingPro, and could see an increase of 36.7% from Tuesday’s closing price of $58.47. That would bring shares closer to their Fair Value of $79.95.

PayPal InvestingPro

At current valuations, PayPal, which is roughly 80% below its July 2021 record high of $310.16, has a market cap of $63 billion.

3. Dollar General

Year-To-Date Performance: -48.2%

Market Cap: $28 Billion

As a stalwart in the retail space, Dollar General (NYSE: ) has faced significant obstacles this year stemming from worries about slowing consumer spending and lingering inflationary pressures. Shares of the discount retailer - which recently slumped to their lowest since December 2018 - have lagged the year-to-date performance of the S&P 500 by a wide margin in 2023, tumbling roughly 48%.

Dollar General Chart

Yet, its recession-proof status as a discount retailer with a wide footprint across rural and suburban areas remains an invaluable asset amid the current backdrop. As bargain-hunting consumers seek value amid economic uncertainties, Dollar General stands poised to benefit. The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based discount retail chain’s strategic initiatives, such as expanding its fresh produce offerings and investing in digital capabilities, aim to bolster its competitive edge.

Additionally, Dollar General’s continuous efforts to return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividend payouts make it an even likelier candidate to outperform in the months ahead. The company recently increased its quarterly cash dividend for the fifth year in a row to $0.59 per share. This represents an annualized dividend of $2.36 and a yield of around 1.9%.

Dollar General's proven ability to navigate through challenging times and maintain its market position signifies resilience that could translate into a turnaround story in 2024.

Indeed, shares appear to be a tad undervalued, as per the quantitative model in InvestingPro, which points to a potential upside of 4.0% from current levels to $132.12. Meanwhile, Wall Street remains bullish on the discount retailer’s long-term growth prospects, with 30 out of 32 analysts surveyed by Investing.com rating DG stock as either a ‘buy’ or a ‘hold’.

At its current share price of $127.50, Dollar General has a market cap of $28 billion, making it the largest U.S. dollar store and one of the biggest discount retailers in the country.

The U.S. stock market looks set to extend its rally through the end of the year, after Wall Street cheered fresh that supported the view that the Federal Reserve may be done raising interest rates.

U.S. October Inflation

Source: Investing.com

Expectations of the Fed cutting rates next year also rose following the soft CPI report. As of Wednesday morning, U.S. rate futures priced in an 80% chance of a rate cut in May, compared with 45% on Monday, according to the .

Fed Rate Odds

The tech-heavy has been the top performer of the three major U.S. indexes by a wide margin so far in 2023, surging 34.7% year-to-date. That compares to an increase of 17.1% for the benchmark over the same time span and a 5.1% gain for the blue-chip .

Nasdaq, DOW, S&P 500 YTD Price Performance

The ongoing rally has been fueled by shares of the mega-cap tech companies, with Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) both posting triple-digit gains thus far, while Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ) are also up solidly on the year.



Taking that into consideration, I recommend buying shares of DraftKings, CrowdStrike, and Datadog amid increasing odds that the Fed is done hiking interest rates and will pivot to easing monetary policy in 2024.

1. DraftKings

*Year-To-Date Performance: +225.1%

*Market Cap: $17.2 Billion

Receding inflation fears and growing optimism that the Fed is all done raising rates will continue to power shares of DraftKings (NASDAQ: ), which has seen its growth story gather momentum lately thanks to an improving fundamental outlook.

DKNG stock ended Tuesday’s session at a fresh 52-week high of $37.03, earning the Boston, Massachusetts-based sportsbook operator a valuation of $17.2 billion.

Shares of the sports betting firm are up an astonishing 225% year-to-date amid excitement over the company’s improved profitability outlook as it cements itself as the leader of the highly competitive online gambling industry.

Notwithstanding the recent turnaround, DKNG still trades 50% below its all-time intraday peak of $74.38 set in March 2021.

DraftKings Chart

The online gambling specialist reported blowout and revenue earlier this month, driven primarily by its efficient acquisition of new customers.

DraftKings reported a net loss of $0.61 per share, narrowing from a loss of $1.00 per share in the same period a year earlier. Revenue for the third quarter jumped 57% annually to $790 million, crushing forecasts for sales of $699 million.

The sports betting company reported 2.3 million monthly unique payers in the third quarter, representing a year-over-year increase of 40%. In addition, the average revenue per monthly unique payer increased by 14% to $114.

Looking ahead, I believe DraftKings is well positioned for further gains as it continues to expand into new jurisdictions and draw in more customers to its platform. Currently, the company is live with mobile sports betting in 22 states and live with iGaming in five states.

2. CrowdStrike

*Year-To-Date Performance: +97.5%

*Market Cap: $49.6 Billion

CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: ) is well placed to extend its powerful rally amid growing bets that the Fed has reached the end of its monetary tightening cycle and as the economy continues to undergo a sea change of digitization.

The Austin, Texas-based information security specialist has been one of the main beneficiaries of the surge in cyber spending from corporations and governments around the world as they respond to growing digital security threats.

Shares broke out to a fresh 52-week high of $209 on Tuesday, a level not seen since April 2022, before closing the session at $207.97. At its current valuation, CrowdStrike has a market cap of about $50 billion.

CRWD stock is 97.5% year-to-date, reflecting the company’s strong fundamentals and long-term growth prospects. Despite the massive rally this year, shares remain roughly 30% away from the all-time high of $298.48 reached in November 2021.

CrowdStrike Chart

Widely viewed as one of the leading names in the cloud-based cybersecurity industry, CrowdStrike is forecast to report explosive profit and sales growth when it delivers third-quarter financial results on November 29.

Consensus calls for earnings per share of $0.74, improving 85% from EPS of $0.40 in the same period last year. Revenue is forecast to climb 34.8% to $777.3 million amid growing demand for its cloud-based cybersecurity platform.

According to an InvestingPro survey, profit estimates have been revised upward 38 times in the past three months, compared to zero downward revisions, as Wall Street grows increasingly bullish on the cybersecurity company.

It should be noted that CrowdStrike has topped Wall Street’s expectations for and revenue in every quarter since it went public in June 2019, underlining the strength of its underlying business.

3. Datadog

*Year-To-Date Performance: +48.4%

*Market Cap: $35.8 Billion

With the Fed likely to start cutting interest rates sooner than expected, I believe that Datadog (NASDAQ: ) is one of the best companies to own amid the current environment as it benefits from strong enterprise demand for its security monitoring and analytics tools.

DDOG ended Tuesday’s session at $109.09, its highest closing price since August 1. At current levels, Datadog has a market cap of $35.8 billion.

Shares of the New York-based company have been on a major uptrend for most of the year, rising around 49% in 2023. Even after the strong year-to-date gains, DDOG stock is still 45% below the record peak of $199.68 reached in November 2021.

Datadog Chart

In a sign of how well its business has performed lately, the cloud security-monitoring platform provider reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and upbeat full-year guidance.

Datadog said adjusted earnings per share improved 95% from the year-ago period to $0.45, better than the $0.34 analysts expected. Revenue for the quarter came out to $547.5 million, up 25% year-over-year, and topping estimates of $524.7 million.

The security software maker said that it had 3,130 customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $100,000 or more as of the end of September, up 20% from the year-ago period.

Datadog’s fourth-quarter outlook made clear it does not expect any slowdown in the coming months, with revenue forecast to grow by 21% year-over-year to a record $566 million.

Apple (NASDAQ: )'s stock, ticker symbol AAPL has gone up to almost its former high. The question is will this stock make another new high?



AAPL investors definitely hope that this stock will continue to give them profits. Let's take a look at this stock from a short term, mid term and long term perspective.





daily chart of AAPL



Let's take a look at the daily chart of AAPL first. We need to establish whether the stock is in an uptrend.



Currently AAPL is above its rising 20 MA, rising 50 MA and rising 200 MA. I put the emphasis on rising.



That's because when the moving averages are rising, the stock is definitely in a strong uptrend.



AAPL is also now in a stage 2 of the stock market stage. You can read more about the 4 stages of the stock market in my article.



One of the reasons why traders and investors lose money is they do the wrong things at each stage. Reading the article will help you to be on the right side of the market.



Coming back to the daily chart, AAPL is indeed in a state of strong power uptrend. The rising 200 MA gives us confidence that the odds of it moving higher in the long run is very good.





weekly chart of AAPL

60 min chart of Apple's stock

To double confirm if the long-term trend is good or not, we will next take a look at the weekly chart of AAPL. There are a few things you need to take note here.First of all, AAPL has broken above a long-term downtrend line. The top of the trend line will be a new support area.The stock has also broken out of a weekly flag. A target can be made from the base to the flag and projected upwards. This is also a measured move and a possible target is shown above.The rising weekly 200 MA also points to the long-term health of AAPL.The 200 MA is a very important moving average that you can use to help you analyze stocks. Read my article on Using The 200 MA As Support to learn more about the 200 MA.Now that we have established the mid-term and long-term strength of the stock, we need to be a complete trader and look at the short-term trend.That's because entry is very important for a trader. You do not want to enter when the stock is about to make a short-term correction.The chart above shows the 60 min chart of AAPL. Previously it broke above a 60 min downtrend line. This is also where it had a bottoming triangle breakout. This itself is a buy setup.The stock also had a bullish 20 MA cross above 50 MA and this set up a strong uptrend in the 60 min chart. When this happens I like to stay bullish on the stock short term till the stock breaks below the 50 MA.From what we can observe right now, the stock has already broken below the 60 min 50 MA and there is also a bearish cross.So while the mid term and long term is good, the short term picture is CAUTION. We should wait for the correction to finish its course before any entry.Correction can happen through sideways trading or a short term downtrend. It is still too early to tell what type of correction it will be but definitely you should be careful before entering this stock at the moment.Wait for a short term breakout or buy the dip.",https://www.investing.com/analysis/apple-can-the-stock-continue-to-go-higher-200643930,0.022,0.904,0.074,0.9706

The value of the has returned to prominence this year, reaching near new annual highs.



Since July, the value of the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies (as measured by the ) has increased from 99 to 105.



This means that the greenback is regaining strength after a period of weakness.



The dollar's rise was surprising, considering that many experts had predicted a decline in 2023.



With the U.S. economy uncertain and estimates of possible recessions, the Fed was sure to cut rates in the following year.



However, the currency's rally proved otherwise.



Despite ups and downs, the dollar continues to maintain an upward trend ahead of the December 13 Fed meeting.



Although no further interest rate increase is expected at this meeting, an aggressive approach by Powell is expected in light of the latest statements.



It is expected that the Fed will keep options open for further tightening if necessary and may delay possible interest rate cuts until late 2024.



However, even if rate cuts are made, they are not likely to be significant because of inflation below the 2 percent target.



To understand the recent increases in the dollar and the reasons behind them, it is necessary to look at global economic dynamics.



The global economic situation is currently deeply divided.



PIL Chart

As the United States continues to defy pessimistic forecasts and growth in China and Europe falters, the dollar has regained strength, rising sharply against major currencies in the past two months.



In late 2022, most economists predicted that the Federal Reserve would act to prevent a possible recession by reducing interest rates.



However, at the present time there appears to be no threat of recession to the economy.



The latest estimate of U.S. GDP shows that the economy is in excellent condition.



The U.S. economy revitalized in the third quarter of 2023, registering an annual growth rate of 4.9 percent.



This represents the highest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2021 and exceeds market forecasts that were on 4.3 percent.



A strong dollar is not good news for the United States, as an increase in its valuation could reduce profits earned abroad.



EUR/USD-Daily Chart

Companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Walt Disney (NYSE: ) Co. have already been affected by this trend in Europe and Asia, with theme park visitors from abroad expected to decline.



Many estimates indicate that even an 8-10 percent increase in the dollar can cause an average 1 percent decline in U.S. companies' profits.



Finally, I anticipate a strong dollar for this quarter and the first quarter of 2024, which is affecting my portfolio choices.



Given my market analysis, I have chosen to avoid U.S. indices such as the Nasdaq and instead focus on Japan's .



Japan's weak currency makes it favorable for my forecast.



The exchange rate could also be at risk of a retest of the 1.00 level.



In my portfolio, I still have investments in and Bitcoin mining stocks, but I anticipate possible short-term weakness with the negative seasonality for this cryptocurrency.

Additionally, a new cash holding record was set at around $157.2 billion, a notable increase from the previous quarter's $147.4 billion.

So, What Strategic Moves Have Warren Buffet and His Company Made?

The record cash holdings stem from capital gains, primarily dividends, and the reduction of some positions. In the last quarter alone, $5 billion worth of securities were divested, contributing to a total of $44 billion over the last twelve months. Stocks no longer considered promising include General Motors Company (NYSE: ), Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), HP (NYSE: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

The most significant moves were observed in Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) with a -10.45% adjustment and complete sell-offs in Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) and General Motors. On the revenue side, noteworthy symbolic purchases include Liberty Media Formula One Corp A (NASDAQ: ), Atlanta Braves Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: ), and Sirius XM Holding Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Earlier this month, the company released its quarterly results, with a positive surprise in both earnings per share and revenue.

Watch Out for a Correction in Apple’s Stock Price

For more than three weeks, Apple's stock price has been moving within a dynamic upward impulse, for which the next target area is the historical maxima located in the price region just below $200. However, the fair value index suggests the possibility of a correction of up to 14%, which would correspond to a rebound near the local support area falling in the vicinity of $164 per share.

5,APPL,2023-11-24,Microsoft May Dethrone Apple as the Most Valuable Stock Soon,"Amid a surge propelled by AI, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is steadily closing in on Apple (NASDAQ: )'s coveted position as the world's most valuable company.

Microsoft received a fresh growth boost in 2023 after the unprecedented demand for AI solutions disrupted the tech sector. Under Satya Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft positioned itself as one of the frontrunners of the ongoing AI revolution, and thanks to this accelerated growth pace, it is becoming an increasing threat to Apple’s ‘most valuable company’ title.

Microsoft’s Rise Backed by AI Goldrush

Apple became the world’s most valuable company in 2011 when its market cap hit $340 billion.

Since then, the iPhone maker has rarely lost this status as it continued its steady growth in the years to come. The company reached the $1 trillion milestone in 2018 and surged close to a $3 trillion valuation this year.

However, there is a growing threat to Apple’s top spot, and it’s none other than its long-time rival Microsoft.

Fueled by the ongoing AI revolution, Microsoft’s valuation surged to over $2.8 trillion in 2023, just 5.7% short of Apple’s $2.98 trillion. The tech giant has been on a relentless rally in 2023, printing new all-time highs multiple times in recent months amid strong demand for its AI and cloud services.

At the moment, MSFT’s stock price is sitting at $377.2, compared to Apple’s $189.7. Microsoft’s shares must surge above the $400.5 mark to dethrone Apple as the most valuable business.

Satya Nadella’s Impact on the Tech Giant

Microsoft’s remarkable ascent in 2023 can be attributed to a harmonious blend of factors. However, when viewed through a wider lens, the company’s new growth stage began in 2014 with the appointment of Satya Nadella as its CEO.

Since taking the helm, the visionary Indian-American business executive has brought significant strategic shifts to the tech giant. Notably, Nadella adopted a cloud-first, mobile-first strategy, reinforcing Microsoft’s dominance in the evolving tech space.

This turned out to be a transformational move for Microsoft, resulting in unprecedented growth in its cloud computing platform, Azure. But in reality, Nadella’s pursuit of innovation has been felt across Microsoft’s entire product and services lineup, including Windows OS and Microsoft Surface.

Fast forward to 2023, the year of the AI revolution, Nadella left nothing to chance. Under his leadership, the company struck a breakthrough partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, pouring $13 billion into Sam Altman’s startup. In return, Microsoft accessed ChatGPT’s underlying large language model (LLM), GPT, which it then used to refresh its products and services – from GitHub over Bing and Office to Azure.

Investor sentiment has surpassed its historical average of 37.5% as the stock market bounced back from the treasury crisis

Investors now wonder whether the rally will sustain into yearend

With that in mind, here are 5 reasons to maintain a bullish outlook

Secure your Black Friday gains with InvestingPro's up to 55% discount!

Against those that keep predicting a doomsday scenario for the market, I maintain a positive outlook for the remainder of the year, supported by various compelling reasons. While the market is ultimately decisive and past performance does not guarantee future result, there are 5 noteworthy factors that investors should pay attention to now.

Let's review them:

1. The Zweig Breadth Thrust Indicator (ZBT) typically signals an approaching interesting point in the markets when transitioning from below 0.40 to above 0.615 within a maximum of 10 days. Such is the setup now.

In fact, the historical figures for the ZBT above the 0.6 threshold are intriguing:

One month later, it averages a +4.8% increase.

Three months later, it averages a +7.5% increase.

Six months later, it averages a +15% increase.

Twelve months later, it averages a +23% increase.

2. Earnings contribute to sustained stock growth. Initially anticipated to be relatively low, Q3 projections now suggest a +6% rise in S&P 500 earnings, signaling a much stronger economy than many predicted.

3. Over the last 44 years (since 1980), the S&P 500 experienced declines of -10% or more in 22 years. In 12 of those years, it subsequently rose by an average of +17%.

4. In the past 95 years, there were only 9 years where the S&P 500 closed negatively in August, September, and October. Subsequent months consistently witnessed market increases (except for one year).

5. Examining the last 10 Fed rate hikes, particularly the final hike concluding the cycle, the S&P 500 rose in 8 instances a year later, averaging a +14.3% increase. The last rate hike on July 26 saw the central bank choosing to keep rates unchanged in both the September 20 and November 1 meetings.

The market is nearly certain this was the last rate hike. If confirmed, the historically bullish period extends until six months after the onset of rate cuts.

Stock Dominance Over Time

Despite the seemingly optimistic outlook, being bullish doesn't always guarantee positive results — unless you are positioned in the right stocks.

With that in mind, let's consider the top-performing stocks in terms of yield in recent years, including dividends. Most of these stocks are well-known to investors.

Best S&P 500 stocks over the last 5 years:

Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ) +1,418%

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) +865%

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ) +775%

Top S&P 500 stocks over the last 10 years:

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ) +12,889%

Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: ) +3,266%

Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) +2,419%

Best S&P 500 stocks over the last 15 years:

NVIDIA +26.078%

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) +14,072%

DexCom (NASDAQ: ) +9,888%

Best S&P 500 stocks over the last 20 years

Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: ) +82,957%

Apple (NASDAQ: ) +51,072%

NVIDIA +32,835%

Best S&P 500 stocks over the last 30 years

Monster Beverage +206.430%

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) +177,354%

Apple +75,322%

The tremendous shift in weight of stocks in the index.

Times change and so do the markets. In the following ranking I'm going to show you the largest weight that stocks had in the S&P500 10 years ago and the one they have today. A radical, drastic change:

10 years ago the stocks with the highest weight in the index were as follows:

Apple: 2.81%.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ): 2.43%.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ): 2.04% Alphabet (NASDAQ: ): 2.04

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ): 1.90%

Currently the most heavily weighted stocks are:

Apple: 7.32%.

Microsoft: 6.92%.

Alphabet: 4.23%

Amazon: 3.75%

In simpler terms, a decade ago, the four largest companies in the S&P 500 accounted for a combined weight of 9.18%. Today, that weight has surged to 22.22%.

This week, the index, where all stocks carry equal weight, experienced a loss of -1.8%, while the traditional S&P 500, with varying weights for each stock, posted a gain of +1.3%.

The credit goes to the impressive performance of the so-called ""Magnificent 7"" stocks, which recorded a +3.8% increase for the week and, due to their substantial weight in the index, propelled it higher. Year to date, the S&P 500 Equal Weight is down -1.7%, which is 17 points less than the S&P 500.

It's worth noting that out of the Magnificent 7, which contributed nearly +40% to the +9.9% annualized return of the S&P 500 from December 2017 through October 2023, five of them still retain their status in this elite group.

Investor sentiment

Bullish sentiment, i.e. expectations that stock prices will rise over the next six months, increased 18.3 percentage points to 42.6% and is above its historical average of 37.5%. This week's increase was the largest since July 15, 2010 (up 18.4 percentage points).

Bearish sentiment, i.e., expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months, declined 23.1 percentage points to 27.2% and is below its historical average of 31%.

Stock market ranking in 2023

This is how the main stock markets are doing so far this year:

+31,83%

Japanese +24.81%.

Italian +20.24% +20.24

+15%

Spanish +13.88% +10.64% +10.64

+10,64%

+9,41%

+8,82%

+3,43%

British -1.22% -1.22

Chinese -13.03% +13.03

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) earnings carry a lot of weight for the entire market because expectations for earnings growth from the chipmaker drive much of the success of the Magnificent Seven and, thus, the . If you want to know why the Magnificent Seven has outperformed this year, it is primarily because of expected earnings growth of some 40% this year and then by 22% next year.

This is the only part of the S&P 500 growing at this pace, especially considering the S&P 500 is expected to see no growth in 2023 and about 10% growth in 2024, based on the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 index. The S&P 500 equal weight index is up less than 5%.

Mag7 Index-EPS

Since the middle of May, when Nvidia reported the blowout earnings report and gave significantly higher than expected guidance, earnings estimates for the group have increased by 17.5% for this year and 18.3% for next year. This, plus some multiple expansions, has helped to drive the Magingificant 7 index higher by around 30%.

Mag7-Growth

Since mid-May, earnings revisions for most of the companies have been modest, and perhaps surprisingly, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) have seen hardly any upward revisions to their forecast, while Tesla (NASDAQ: ) has seen its earnings forecast slashed.

Meta (NASDAQ: ) has seen healthy upward revisions, and anyone who has followed Amazon (NASDAQ: ) long enough knows that earnings growth from the company is not dependable. The only company that has seen a huge and outsized increase in earnings revisions is Nvidia. Nvidia’s earnings estimates since its May earnings reports have risen by almost 140% for fiscal year 2024 and 190% for fiscal year 2025.

NVIDIA Growth

Source: Bloomberg

Therefore, it seems pretty logical to assume that almost all of the increase in earnings estimates we have seen in the Magnificent Seven has come from Nvidia since the rest of the index is not delivering much if any, increase in earnings revisions since the middle of May. Additionally, Nvidia accounts for about 25% of the overall growth in the total index from this year to next year.

This tells us just how important Nvidia has become to the story of the Magnificent Seven and, more importantly, how vital guidance from the company will be when it reports results this week. It will need to support the current earnings estimates and, more importantly, be better than expected to drive earnings growth higher to help propel the market further to the upside.

The options market appears to be very bullish on Nvidia, at least based on the skew of the 95% and 105% moneyness strike prices. The skew has swung back to the call side of the equation from heavily skewed to the puts side. This tells us that implied volatility for the calls is rising, which suggests that the demand for the calls is stronger than that of the puts. This is similar to what was seen in the July.

NVDA-Weekly Volume Chart

The Nvidia long straddle, which means owning one call and one put for the same expiration date, suggests the stock rises or falls by 6.8% by options expiring on November 24. One would think that as we approach results on November 21 after the close of trading, that IV continues to rise, and that implied move also increases.

NVDA-Long Straddle

Source: Bloomberg

This means that once the results come out, the implied volatility, which I assume will be at levels equal to that of July at over 100%, will melt, and that means that the values of the puts and the calls will start to decay as the IV returns to lower levels. It is important to remember that the market is closed on Thursday and is only a half day on Friday. Additionally, since the call activity has been heavier, there is far more call delta for expiration on Friday than the put delta.

Based on the data from Bloomberg and what I could calculate, the max call delta comes at $500. I estimate a total notional call delta of about $3.33 billion, a notional put delta of about $1.06 billion, and a total positive delta of $2.28 billion. This tells us that instead of an implied volatility crush sending the stock higher as puts and calls lose value, causing market makers to buy back hedges, since skew typically put heavy, when the calls start to lose value, the stock will see market maker most likely unwind long hedging and sell the stock.

NVDA-Call Delta

Suppose the results are stellar and significantly better than the expected $3.36 per share and $16.1 billion in revenue for the fiscal third quarter, and the guidance for the fourth quarter is considerably better than the $3.76 per share and $17.9 billion revenue estimates, then the stock could rise. However, it would seem that anything inline or slightly better, may not be good enough and could result in the stock falling.

The stock has certainly been range-bound for a few months now, and if one wanted to, you call this a solid five waves up for the stock if you go back to the rally that started in 2015. Some Fibonacci levels seem to work in more than one place.

The US stock market remains on track to be the performance leader in 2023 for the major asset classes – by a wide margin. The key reason: Big-tech shares are running hot. Take out these companies from the mix and US equities’ year-to-date results fade to a mediocre performance in line with the return on money-market funds.

Market-cap-weighted equities in the US space, which are dominated by big-tech, are far and away the year-to-date leader, based on a set of ETFs through Friday’s close (Nov. 24). Vanguard Total US Stock Market Index Fund (NYSE: ) is up 19.2% so far in 2023, far ahead of the rest of the primary slices of world markets.

The next-best performer this year: developed-markets stocks ex-US ( ), which is ahead by a relatively moderate 11.6%. The Global Market Index (GMI) is ahead by nearly 13% this year. (This unmanaged benchmark, maintained by CapitalSpectator.com, holds all the major asset classes — except cash — in market-value weights and represents a competitive benchmark for multi-asset-class portfolios.)

GMI ETFs YTD Total Returns

Within the US equities space, big-tech is driving the horse race by a hefty degree. iShares Technology ETF (NYSE: ), which is heavily weighted in the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), has surged more than 49% in 2023 – more than double the gain for US shares overall (VTI).

A better comparison tracks how the average stock is faring via an equal-weighted portfolio, which removes the big-tech factor. Notably, the 5.4% year-to-date return for Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE: ) is only modestly above the performance for a cash proxy ( ).

XLK-Daily Chart

All of which sets out a key question for asset allocation and investment strategy in 2024: Will US stocks (a.k.a. big tech) continue to outperform? No one knows, of course, but after such a stellar run there’s a case for caution in expecting a repeat performance. Yet David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, remains optimistic.

“Our baseline forecast suggests that in 2024 the mega-cap tech stocks will continue to outperform the remainder of the ,” he predicts. Rising sales are the reason, he explains. “Analyst estimates show the mega-cap tech companies growing sales at a CAGR of 11% through 2025 compared with just 3% for the rest of the S&P 500. The net margins of the Magnificent 7 are twice the margins of the rest of the index, and consensus expects this gap will persist through 2025.”

Add in rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates and it’s easy to see the framework that could keep big-tech shares bubbling.

“Wall Street is gearing up for rate cuts,” reports The Wall Street Journal. “Twenty months after the Federal Reserve began a historic campaign against inflation, investors now believe there is a much greater chance that the central bank will cut rates in just four months than raise them again in the foreseeable future.”

The danger is that the future’s still uncertain and no forecast is assured. The tailwinds in favor of big tech certainly look bullish at the moment, but the world remains filled with hazards and the crowd has priced in virtually no margin for error re: the biggest, most successful corporate titans.",https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-us-stocks-lead-global-markets-again-in-2024-big-tech-has-the-answer-200643909,0.037,0.871,0.092,0.9844

More Information

Timothy Fries is the co-founder and CFO of The Tokenist, as well as a Partner of Protective Technologies Capital, a niche-focused, boutique private equity firm. He's been an active investor in public and private markets his entire life. Tim is passionate about helping others optimize their wealth creation in a risk-adjusted manner. His goal with The Tokenist is to help translate the most sophisticated and transparent portfolio construction strategies and management tools to non-professional investors. Tim finds it frustrating that most financial advisors don't recommend the same modern portfolio theory strategies that sophisticated institutional investors like endowments and pension funds utilize. A cynic might suggest this is because advisors can't charge a percentage-based fee on assets like real estate, VC/PE, crypto, etc. that aren't under their custody. An optimist (Tim's preferred perspective) may counter by offering that this disconnect exists mainly due to an education and product offering gap among most investors. Tim is passionate about helping fill this gap.
